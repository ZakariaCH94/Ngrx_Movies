This project was generated with Angular CLI version 9.0.4.

Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Notes
if you want to test the application in mock mode must uncomment line 247 and 248 of the fake-backend.service.ts file when launching the server then commenting them out once the server is started.

otherwise you can use the REST API "https://github.com/ZakariaCH94/API_Movies/tree/main/API" (SPRING BOOT). Don't forget to change urls in movies.service.ts file
